If you can't point out that spelling error then go get an eye checkup. \nIn C, once again the tense inconsistency. \nD is correct as it has a consistent use of past tense. Themselves is perfect to use because the focus is more on the individuals. \nHad realised is a redundent use of had, the 'had' written before 'taken' is enough for those two verbs. The use of 'had been behaving' implies that this action started before the main event, before they were even stuck in a cave. Using 'itself' with group is correct but then it would have created pronoun inconsistency as the next sentence uses 'they'."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "When rewriting direct speech to indirect speech, there are rules which you are supposed to follow. First you start from the beginning, here \"Lily tells Marshall\" is in simple present tense. When rewriting to indirect speech, you are supposed to change simple present tense to simple past tense. A conjunction such as 'that' is preferable but not necessary in all kinds of sentences. Next, \"I dreamt about\" is in simple past tense and the pronoun is first person. Here, you will change the pronoun from first person to third person and then you will change the tense from simple past to past perfect. The following sentence is merely extra information. It's not the action, the subject or the object of the sentence and hence doesn't require any change."

      "None of these"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "When rewriting indirect speech to direct speech, there are rules which we must follow. First of all, a comma after who tells who and double inverted commas to enclose the main speech are necessary. Starting from the beginning, \"Zack asked Aarav\" is in simple past tense. We are supposed to change it to simple present. We remove the conjunction 'if' because the other sentence is now enclosed with quotation marks. The following words up until 'when' are then changed from simple past to simple present and the pronouns are changed from third person to first person. In direct speech, we use simple past tense instead of past perfect when referring to a past event. Because of that, the tense gets changed from past perfect to simple past after the usage of 'when'. What about the sentence after 'that'? You would be euthanized remains unchanged as Zack is recollecting a past memory where he might've said you will be euthanized. Even if he had said you would be euthanized the time he actually told this to Aarav, Zack might've just used the original sentence this time for a more dramatic approach."
